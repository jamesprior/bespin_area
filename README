BespinArea
==========

<<BESPIN DESCRIPTION>>

BespinArea is a Ruby on Rails plugin consisting of ActionView helpers and Javascript to bind a Bespin editor to a text area.
It is the goal of this project to make the replacement as seamless as possible by not requiring any additional JavaScript 
libraries and not impacting the functioning of any text areas if bespin is not supported in the client browser.

There are two options that can be set globally:
ActionView::bespin_areas = [true | false] 
ActionView::bespin_default_options is a hash passed to the bespin editor.

both text_area and text_area_tag both accept a :bespin option along with the html options.  Set it to true or false to control
the default behavior, pass it a hash to enable the editor and include the options.
